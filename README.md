# Miuchiz-Custom-Launcher

This allows you to enable cheats before connecting to Miuchiz Reborn. This is included as a part of Miuchiz R4 and higher, which can be found at http://miuchiz.xyz.

Using a cheat creates a modified version of aworld.exe as mion.exe by modifying certain bytes:

Object selection: Replaces 0x000D66ED-0x000D66F2 with 0x90

Noclip: Replaces 0x000FEDF0 with 0xEB

Flight: Replaces 0x000FF3BF and 0x000FF426 with 0xEB
